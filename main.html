     <h1> Romeo and Juliet</h1>
     <h3>ACT 1</h3>
     <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
     <p>Two households, both alike in dignity. <br>
         infer Verona, where we lay out scene <br>
         From anciant grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
         Where civil blood mates civil hands unclear <br>
         From forth the fatal loins of these two foes <br>
         A pair of sts' lovers take the life <br>
         Whose misadventured piteous overthrows <br>
         Do with their death bury ther parents strife <br> 
         The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love <br>
         And the continuance of their passage <br>
         Which but their children's and, nought could remove <br> 
         Is now the two hours traffic of our stage: <br>
         The which if you with patient ears attend, <br>
         What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mand</p>
     <h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
     <p><i> Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i></p>
     <h3>SAMPSON</h3>
     <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
     <h3>GREGORY</h3>
     <p>No, for then we should be colliers</p>
